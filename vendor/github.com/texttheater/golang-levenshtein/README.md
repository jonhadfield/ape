golang-levenshtein
==================

An implementation of the Levenshtein algorithm in Go. Provides edit distances,
edit scripts and ratios for strings (slices of runes).

For a package that is similar but more generic and provides more control,
check out Daniël de Kok’s
[editdistance](https://github.com/danieldk/editdistance).
